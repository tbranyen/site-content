It's bittersweet to announce that I'm leaving [Bocoup](http://bocoup.com) to
join the development team at [Matchbox](http://matchbox.net) as an Open Source
Developer.

Matchbox is removing the barriers to enrolling at educational institutions
through their existing iPad application and soon-to-be web interfaces.  My
Backbone.js and open source related experience will be utilized to provide
best-in-class experiences.  Matchbox is using and contributing to various open
source projects including: [Backbone
Boilerplate](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate) and
[LayoutManager](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager).  I am very
excited to help own their product and make it the best it can possibly be.

I am continuing the mission that Bocoup has inspired into me the past two
years.  They taught me how to run meetups, speak at conferences, contribute to
open soruce projects, become part of the community, and teach others what I've
learned through trainings.

I'm looking forward to the future and what it will bring.
