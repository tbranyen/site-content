title: 'Announcing Backbone.js LayoutManager'

Designing an application with Backbone.js is amazing; it's flexible
and fits in comfortably with my development processes.  Since this library
doesn't formalize common tasks like templating, it's all-too-easy to fall into
the repetitive flow of rewriting the same template
fetching/rendering/assembling for every project.

LayoutManager formalizes from start to finish the fetching of
layouts and templates, the rendering in any engine, and assembling into the
DOM.  Configuration is minimal to get it working with various engines
(Mustache/Handlebars) and transport methods (DOM/AJAX).
